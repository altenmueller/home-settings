## clipboard sharing
install xquartz (need this for x11 forwarding!)
run xquartz look inside the preferences, ensure clipboard sharing is enabled
install xclip
add 
        <key>LSUIElement</key>
        <true/>
to the end of /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app/Contents/Info.plist
this hides XQuartz while it's running
have to run xterm and quit initially to get clipboard sharing to work
if you run echo "test"|xclip -i -selection clipboard it should get synced
make sure vim is compiled with x11 support and set its register to unnamedplus (the clipboard)
add XQuartz to the startup items
need to make sure xterm runs and then exits

add this to your ~/.ssh/config:
    ForwardX11 yes
    ForwardX11Trusted yes
This will ensure that X11 sessions don't time out


## vm
increase number of cpus
increase memory
add host-only adapter and set static ip on it
add nat adapter so it can connect to the internet
ssh to the host only adapter so the connection doesn't get interrupted when you unplug

## building
modify ib so that it prints the compiler commands

## youcompleteme

We need to use an older version because our codebase only works with clang-3.8 right now.

cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe.git
git checkout e332cdb2a0c8599dead1d362b87bb9fb79c9a955

change first line of install.py to
#!/usr/bin/env python3

run git submodule update --init --recursive

in third_party/ycmd/cpp/CMakeLists.txt, go to line 208, and add below
set(Python_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS 3.4)

then go to ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
run ./install.py --clang-completer

## ctrl-h in vim

in iterm:

Edit -> Preferences -> Keys
Press +
Press Ctrl+h as Keyboard Shortcut
Choose Send Escape Sequence as Action
Type [104;5u for Esc+

then in your ssh session:

(this was the original command from the internet)
infocmp $TERM | sed 's/kbs=^[hH]/kbs=\\177/' > $TERM.ti
tic $TERM.ti

however kbs was already set to \177. I changed kbs= to kbs=\E[104;5u
and then reran tic
seemed to work.
